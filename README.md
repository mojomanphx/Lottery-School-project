# Lottery Project

## Overview 
 This was a school project for my Java II class.  The program should allow the user to choose 6 different 
 numbers via checkboxes.  Then the program will randomly choose six unique numbers.  Finally the program will award money 
 based on amount of correctly choosen numbers.  

### How I accomplished this....
 First I needed to identify the components of the program.  What did it need to do, how does it interact with the user, 
 what information needed to be captured and how would the output look.
 * This was successful because of a crude flowchart, and from that created a list of needed variables, objects and storage solutions.  
 Next I broke the progam down into sections.  Here is what I am most proud of out of each section.    
 * Container  
   - Use of for loop to create, add and initiate action listener for all checkbox objects. 
   - Use of arrays as storage units for checkbox objects.  
 * User Entry   
 * Game Operation  
 * Winning Analzyation and Output
 
 **_Each of the sections above were psuedocoded, entered into JGrasp, finally debugged before moving onto the next section._**
